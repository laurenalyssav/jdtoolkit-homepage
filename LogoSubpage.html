</p> For this assignment in Journalism and Design Toolkit, I wanted to create a logo that 
would be purposeful for multiple things. I wanted to create a logo that is versatile in 
so I could place it on resumes, invoices, emails, and more!

For the logo itself, I used my first, middle, and laste name initials while sticking with 
a single color palette to speak true to my own style. In addition, I was also able to 
manipulate the lettering by adjusting how each letter lined up in order to make it 
logo-like and seamless in its design.
