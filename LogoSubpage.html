</p> For this assignment in Journalism and Design Toolkit, I wanted to create a logo that could be put to
good use and was versatile in that I could use it on things like my resume or at the end of my emails.
I simply put my first, middle, and laste name initials and tried to stick with a single color palette to speak 
true to my own style. In addition, I was also able to manipulate  the lettering by adjusting how each letter lined up
in order to make it logo-like and seamless in its design.
