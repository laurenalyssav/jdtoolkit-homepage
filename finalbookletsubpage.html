<p> For my final project in this Journalism Design and Toolkit course, I wanted to create 
my own Quarantine Cookbook (for non-cooks). This idea came from a place of wanting to
help other students and provide super easy recipes with minimal ingredients. As a non-cook
myself, I wanted to take away the extra stress of figuring out different recipes.
Especially during these trying times, the last thing many of us want to do is cook complex 
meals or have to order takeout.  </p>

<p> This Quarantine Cookbook uses minimal ingredients and steps. Enjoy! </p>
